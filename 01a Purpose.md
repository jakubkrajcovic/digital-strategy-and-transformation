# Purpose

The purpose of this publication is to collect and create an easily editable and easily consumable blueprint to help people and organizations better understand digital and cloud transformation, strategy and lay of the land. The reason I am starting this collection is to have a single repository of information that I can refer to and start treating as a "digital and cloud body of knowledge". Many publications out there are too abstract on the management consulting side, or too technical, or cover to much of a broad range of everything. What I'm trying to do here is:
- Distill information from various sources and provide it in a pragmatic and useful way
- Focus on what I consider cloud and digital: Public cloud, SaaS, IoT and so on...
- Not focusing on private cloud (not much at least)
- This is a no-dinosaur zone which means we do not consider the "traditional" IT players as valid and relevant in the cloud and digital space anymore and hence will not be covering them / writing about them. This includes companies like Cisco, HP, Oracle, Dell, IBM and many more. We also consider big telco's to be dinosaurs for the purpose of this publication and in the context of the cloud and digital world.
- Our focus is on "cloud natives", "digital natives" and "born in the cloud" startups / companies. Ideally we want to cover and point to companies that are in getting past the point of inflection and have not sold out to one of the "traditional" players and are not planning to
- I also want to cover cloud and digital adoption in Europe as opposed to North America and APAC. The reason for this is that Europe is a very splintered market and a lot of the traditional Telcos are in the cloud game, and are pushing their own versions of OpenStack or something similar - which is basically the same old thing as pushing tin and trying to sell their pre-provisioned and expensive datacenter space and capacity.

## Audience
Full transparency: I am still working out who the audience for this publication is. The main reason why I started this is to collect information and create a body of knowledge to serve as a basis for developing cloud and digitally native, pragmatic consulting services and products for people and organizations alike.
