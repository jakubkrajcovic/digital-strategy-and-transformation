Digital Transformation according to Microsoft:

**1. Engaging Customers**
  * This is basically saying that you should have a digital sales pipeline and should track the customer lifecycle and use analytics in your sales process

**2. Empowering Employees**
  * Sharing information through using Office 365, Skype and Yammer, etc...
  * Use mobile apps (Qantas is a good story for this)

**3. Optimizing Operations**
