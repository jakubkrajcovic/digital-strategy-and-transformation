# Components of a cloud strategy

**1. How to Develop a cloud business case?**
- how to perform IT financial modeling for cloud transition
- how to estimate the total value of cloud ownership
- Simple stuff only, I’m not asking for any deep dives into most common ROI, TCO or NPV models.

**2. How to drive organizational change management for cloudofobic organizations?**
- How do new cloud-friendly IT roles and job descriptions look like? 
- What is the new ideal org structure and how to layoff all the laggards and trim the IT org down?

**3. Cloud disposition practices**
- Refactoring over replatforming preferences
- what tools to use for large-scale application assessments
- How does an efficient application migration factory work
- how to increase its velocity and improve quality? 
- How fast can you move a full enterprise into a cloud?

**4. Service orientation and API management in the cloud**
- Tell me how you used Mashery or Apigee and how are they different from AWS API Gateway or Azure Apiphany?

**5. DevOps principles and tools**
- Do you prefer Bamboo, Codeship, Travis CI or ElectricFlow? 
- For continuous deployment, do you like Capistrano over RapidDeploy? 
- What is your experience with Cucumber, Selenium, Appium or FitNesse?

**6. Ah, you are more of a cloud infrastructure expert?**
- Great, let’s talk about Cowbar, StackStorm and Rundeck. 
- Or, if you are more of an old-school traditionalist, I’d love to hear your views on Terraform, Ansible, Puppet or Chef.

**7. Cloud storage and persistency technologies**
- Do you prefer CouchDB or DashDB? Can MongoDB scale better than Cassandra or Neo4j? 
- Do you see future in NewSQL engines in the cloud, such as VoltDB, NuoDB and MemSQL? 
- How about advantages of Redis over Memcached or Aerospike for distributed caching?
