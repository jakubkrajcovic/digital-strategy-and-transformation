## Economics of org change
Let's face it, organizational change will have impact on many people. Some will lose their jobs, some will shift to new roles (potentially with higher salaries) and in general the trend will be to lessen the number of people across all levels of the organizaton, however it is very likely that the salaries for the people left will need to be higher.
